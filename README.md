# Visual Studio Code Config

My personal VS Code config / setup.

## Extensions

To install all of these extensions quickly, run the included bash script:

`$ ./vscode-extension-install.sh`

If you get a permissions issue, run this command instead:

`sudo chmod u+x vscode-extension-install.sh`

Here is a list of the extensions that will be installed:

- **Auto Import** by steoates

## Settings

To update your VS Code settings, open the command palette by hitting `F1`, or `Ctrl + Shift + P` if you are on Windows, or `Cmd + Shift + P` if you are on Mac.

Then select `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)` from the dropdown menu.

Now simply copy + paste the code from the included `settings.json` file into the `settings.json` file you just opened
